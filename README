***ABOUT CONTROLLER COM PORTS***
Each time the settings menu is activated, your computer is scanned for available COM ports the server app can communicate over.  
If you do not see a list of available COM ports in the drop down menu, make sure the Reef Angel TTL USB cable is plugged in and drivers installed correctly. 
- Make sure SET RTS on close is checked
- Baud Rate = 57600

**ABOUT SERIAL LIBRARIES**
Native java communication to serial ports is not cross platform with the javax.comm libraries available from sun.  The library RXTX should fill this gap for us.
The RXTXcomm.jar is included (lib folder) and referenced in the project.  Additionally the rxtxParallel.dll and rxtxSerial.dll also need to be copied the users JAVA_HOME\bin directory.
e.x(C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin)

Different versions of the two compiled libraries are available and need to be copied accordingly (x86 vs x64)
